# Lucas's dotfiles

This setup contains all of my dotfiles for MacOS and Gentoo Linux. This setup is intended to function out of one repo, being agnostic for both systems. Other linux distros are untested and YMMV, but anything using systemd or OpenRC with user services (OpenRC>=0.62) should be fine.
